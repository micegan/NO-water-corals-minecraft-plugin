# NO-water-corals-minecraft-plugin
Against all the evil that Sun can conjure, all the wickedness that Steave can produce, we will send unto them... only coral. Shine and burn, until it is done for, for ever.

Makes every coral eternaly burn on the sun without an ability to die!
(Corals can stay on the surface without a bottle of water)

Dead corals could be received in survival mode by smelting regular corals inside of a furnace.
